# PPO-Based Traffic Light Monitoring System

## Overview
This project implements a **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) model** to optimize traffic light control in mixed traffic environments. The model is designed to minimize waiting times and queue lengths while improving traffic throughput using the **SUMO** traffic simulator.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following key files:

- **`PPO.ipynb`** - Implements the PPO reinforcement learning model to optimize traffic light control at a single intersection.
- **`Fixed.ipynb`** - Implements a fixed traffic light monitoring system to compare performance with the RL-based model.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks, install the following dependencies:

'''bash
pip install jupyter numpy matplotlib gym tensorflow torch stable-baselines3 sumo
'''

## SUMO Installation
SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) is required to run the simulations. Install it using:

Linux:

'''bash
sudo apt-get install sumo
'''

macOS:
'''bash
brew install sumo
'''

Windows:
Download and install SUMO from Eclipse SUMO (href: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.php).

## How to Run
Open Jupyter Notebook:
'''bash
jupyter notebook
'''
Open Fixed.ipynb to analyze the fixed traffic light monitoring system.
Open PPO.ipynb to train and evaluate the PPO-based model.
Run all the cells in sequence.

## Methodology
Environment Setup: SUMO simulates a single intersection with mixed traffic conditions.
Reinforcement Learning (PPO):
  State Space: Number of vehicles, waiting time, and current traffic signal phase.
  Action Space: Choosing an optimal green light phase.
  Reward Function: Minimizes waiting time and queue length.
  Comparison: The performance of fixed-time vs. RL-based adaptive control is evaluated.
